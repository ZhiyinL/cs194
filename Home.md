## New developer?
We're so excited to have you join the team! ❤️ Check out [Developer Environment Setup](https://github.com/StanfordCS194/spr23-Team21/wiki/Developer-Environment-Setup) for first steps.

## Project Synopsis
We’re building [CuteQueue](https://cutequeue.com), an office hours queue platform with the primary goal of integrating the queue into the student’s learning experience. Our focus is on scaffolding student requests, improving communication between staff and students, and enhancing visual design—before, during, and after being helped—all to improve student self-efficacy.
